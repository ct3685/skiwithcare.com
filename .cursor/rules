## Brand Fundamentals

**Product Name:** SkiWithCare

- CamelCase in code identifiers: `SkiWithCare`, `skiWithCare`
- Human-facing prose: "Ski With Care" or "SkiWithCare"
- Domain: skiwithcare.com

**Primary Tagline:** Care Near the Slopes

**Mission:** Help dialysis patients and caregivers plan ski trips by finding dialysis clinics near ski resorts.

## Official Brand Colors (from Logo)

The logo features:

- **Pink** `#e879a0` — Skier silhouette, mountain peak, medical cross
- **Cyan** `#64d9f7` — Flowing wave element
- **Dark Background** `#0f0a12` — Deep purple-black

These match the **Rose** theme (default). The logo should always appear on dark backgrounds for best contrast.

## Tone & Voice

**Be:** Calm, reassuring, trustworthy, competent, supportive

**Avoid:**

- Extreme-sports vibe ("shred", "epic", "gnarly")
- Hype language ("amazing", "incredible", "game-changer")
- Fear tactics or urgency ("don't miss out", "act now")
- Overly clinical jargon ("hemodialysis facility", "renal replacement")

**Preferred Language:**

- care, nearby, planning, support, confidence
- access, coordinate, trip, clinic, resort
- find, discover, explore, prepare

## Three Color Themes (Preserve These)

The project has three color themes that must be preserved:

1. **Rose** — Pink (#e879a0) + Cyan (#64d9f7)

   - Warm, caring, approachable
   - Default theme

2. **Alpine** — Coral (#f97316) + Ice Blue (#38bdf8)

   - Adventurous, sunset warmth
   - Energetic but not extreme

3. **Glacier** — Teal (#14b8a6) + Blue (#3b82f6)
   - Cool, serene, calming
   - Winter ice tones

Each theme has light and dark variants. Always maintain this theming system.

## UX & Content Rules

1. **Prioritize clarity and user trust** over cleverness
2. **Microcopy should reduce anxiety** and be action-oriented (no pressure)
3. **Accessibility first:** contrast, readable headings, predictable layout
4. **Mobile-first:** All features must work well on mobile devices
5. **No external dependencies** where possible (vanilla JS preferred)

---

## Engineering & Naming

- Component names: PascalCase, brand-prefixed when relevant
- Function names: camelCase, descriptive
- CSS variables: `--accent-primary`, `--bg-primary`, etc.
- GA4 events: snake_case, descriptive (`theme_change`, `near_me_click`)
- Keep configuration centralized in CSS variables
